          (“Internet platforms”) approved by WWF.
        </li>
        <li>
          C. At this time, End User or holder of 1776 Tokens should have no

          trade their products or services products and services within Internet
          Platforms marketplaces and optionally accept the 1776 Token as trade.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          H. The value of many millions of product listings that utilize the

          present date the 1776 Token has never been listed in nor traded in any
          centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. It is estimated that if the 1776
          Token were potentially traded in a cryptocurrency exchange, its
          opening estimated fiat price could be $1.00.
